This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).




Project Introduction 

	This is front-end side README.md

	to check back-end

	go to 
	:  https://github.com/JunSeo99/priorify-backend.git

	This is a Team Project of Open Source SW(Basic), Team 16.
	We named our project Priorify.
 	
	Priorify is a compund word of Priority and Simplify.
	Priorify is a project to develop a graphical to-do web app using Next.js. 
	User will be noticed visually by changing sized and colors depending on the task's importance.
	
	User just need to type on sentence. Then, our fine-tuned LLaMA will categorize and make graph that user don't have to worry about.

	Our team will both handle front-end and back-end. 
	On front-end side, we will use Next.js, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript.
	On back-end side, we will use Spring Boot, MongoDB, AWS EC2.
	For deployment, Webhook and CodeDeploy Agent are chosen.

	Since it is an Open Source Class, we will utilize two Open Source resources.
	For auto-categorization, we will fine-tune LLaMA API.
	For actual visualization, we will use D3.js.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.
